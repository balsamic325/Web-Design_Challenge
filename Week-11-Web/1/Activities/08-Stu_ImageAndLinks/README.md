### Instructions

In this activity, we will create an HMTL page with some plots . The images can be found in the folder `assets/images`. The page should have the following elements:

1. At the top of the HTML page, add a H1 tag containing the name of your chosen project.

2. For each image, add one image element to your `index.html` file. Set the `src` attribute of each image to the path to a different image. Be sure to add a description for each image in the `alt` attribute.

3. Add a horizontal rule between each image.

4. Underneath each image, add a description of its graph in italicized text using the `<em>` element.

5. Add functionality so that when an image is clicked, it will open a new tab to that image's URL.

### Bonus

Take advantage of the `figure` and `figcaption` elements to have more semantic markup.
