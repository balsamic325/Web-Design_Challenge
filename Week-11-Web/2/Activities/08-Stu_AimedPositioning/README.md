# Aimed Positioning of HTML Elements

## Instructions

* Open the [Unsolved Starter](Unsolved/AimedPositioning.html).

* Using CSS, position the five headers in the starter code in their described locations.

## Hints

* You can move elements around the page using pixels OR percentages. Try out both to see how they work.

* Not every task is capable of being accomplished without changing the order of HTML elements. Even then, some positions may still be impossible.

### Bonus

* Try to move the HTML elements provided using different kinds of positioning (static, relative, and fixed).
